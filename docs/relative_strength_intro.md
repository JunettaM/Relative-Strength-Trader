# Introduction to Relative Strength (RS)

Relative Strength (RS) is a technical analysis tool used by traders to compare the performance of one asset against another, or against a market benchmark.

## Why Use Relative Strength?
- **Identify Leaders**: Find stocks or assets outperforming the market.
- **Spot Weakness**: Avoid underperforming investments.
- **Trend Confirmation**: Support buy/sell decisions with performance data.

## How to Calculate RS
1. Pick the asset (e.g., Stock A) and a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500 index).
2. Divide the asset’s price by the benchmark’s price over the same time frame.
3. Track the ratio over time — an upward trend means the asset is outperforming.
